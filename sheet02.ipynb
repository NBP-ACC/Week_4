    "In this exercise sheet you will have to work with ```pandas``` and ```seaborn```. ```pandas``` is one of the most preferred and widely used tools in data processing. What’s cool about ```pandas``` is that it takes data (like a CSV or TSV file, or a SQL database) and creates a Python object with rows and columns called 'data frame' that looks very similar to tables in a statistical software (think Excel or SPSS for example). ```pandas``` makes data processing a lot easier in comparison to working with lists and/or dictionaries through for-loops or list comprehension.  \n",
    "```seaborn``` is a library for making plots. It is based on ```matplotlib``` but offers more functions speicialized for statistical visualization. Also most people agree that ```seaborn``` looks more legit.\n",
